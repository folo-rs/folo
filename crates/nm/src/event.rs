/// Allows you to observe the occurrences of an event in your code.
///
/// The typical pattern is to observe events via thread-local static variables.
///
/// # Publishing models
///
/// The ultimate goal of the metrics collected by an [`Event`] is to end up in a [`Report`][1].
/// There are two models by which this can happen:
///
/// - **Pull** model - the reporting system queries each event in the process for its latest data
///   set when generating a report. This is the default and requires no action from you.
/// - **Push** model - data from an event only flows to a thread-local [`MetricsPusher`][2], which
///   publishes the data into the reporting system on demand. This requires you to periodically
///   trigger the publishing via [`MetricsPusher::push()`][3].
///
/// The push model has lower overhead but requires action from you to ensure that data is published.
/// You may consider using it under controlled conditions, such as when you are certain that every
/// thread that will be reporting data will also call the pusher at some point.
///
/// The choice of publishing model can be made separately for each event.
///
/// # Example (pull model)
///
/// ```
/// use nm::Event;
///
/// thread_local! {
///     static CONNECT_TIME_MS: Event = Event::builder()
///         .name("net_http_connect_time_ms")
///         .build();
/// }
///
/// pub fn http_connect() {
///     CONNECT_TIME_MS.with(|e| e.observe_duration_millis(|| {
///         do_http_connect();
///     }));
/// }
/// # http_connect();
/// # fn do_http_connect() {}
/// ```
///
/// # Example (push model)
///
/// ```
/// use nm::{Event, MetricsPusher, Push};
///
/// thread_local! {
///     static HTTP_EVENTS_PUSHER: MetricsPusher = MetricsPusher::new();
///
///     static CONNECT_TIME_MS: Event<Push> = Event::builder()
///         .name("net_http_connect_time_ms")
///         .pusher_local(&HTTP_EVENTS_PUSHER)
///         .build();
/// }
///
/// pub fn http_connect() {
///     CONNECT_TIME_MS.with(|e| e.observe_duration_millis(|| {
///         do_http_connect();
///     }));
/// }
///
/// loop {
///     http_connect();
///
///     // Periodically push the data to the reporting system.
///     if is_time_to_push() {
///         HTTP_EVENTS_PUSHER.with(MetricsPusher::push);
///     }
///     # break; // Avoid infinite loop when running example.
