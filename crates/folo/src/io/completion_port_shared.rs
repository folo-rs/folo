/// The I/O completion port is used to notify the I/O driver that an I/O operation has completed.
/// It must be associated with each file/socket/handle that is capable of asynchronous I/O. We do
/// not expose this in the public API, just use it internally to implement I/O primitives.
///
/// There are two different types of I/O completion ports in Folo:
///
/// 1. Each async worker thread has a single I/O completion port dedicated for all thread-isolated
///    I/O operations that never extend outside that thread.
/// 2. There is a shared I/O completion port used for multithreaded I/O operations. All async worker
///    threads share this and process I/O whose completion is scheduled via this port.
///
/// This is the multithreaded completion port that is shared by all async workers and used for I/O
/// that spans across threads. Just wrap it in an Arc. Interior mutability is used - no need to take
/// any exclusive references.
