// TODO: In a real implementation we should split this up into multiple layers:
// 1) Validation and input processing (what is the command, is it valid in context, etc).
// 2) Passing to an actual command channel.
//    - May be a buffering command channel in case we are commanding it from an owned thread.
//    - May be a direct command channel in case we are commanding it from an unowned thread.
// 3) The command sender implementation that actually communicates with agents.
// Potentially even split the first layer in two for a separate public and private API layer?
// We should also reduce the weirdness of the design in general - do we really need it to be
// interior mutable? Do we really need it to be thread-safe? There are some situations today where
// the answer is "yes" but they are something like 1% of the use cases - can we do better?
