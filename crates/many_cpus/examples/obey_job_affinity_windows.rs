//! The mechanism used in Windows to enforce limits on processes is Job Objects. Processes are
//! assigned to jobs, and jobs can be constrained to only use a limited set of processors.
//!
//! This example proves that the APIs we offer do not "see" the universe outside of the limits
//! of the current process's job object constraints on processor affinity (which processors
//! the process is allowed to use).
//!
//! Job object limits are hard limits, whereas all other mechanisms to define affinity (e.g. CPU
//! sets and legacy "process affinity masks") are just wishes by the process in question.
//! In case of conflicting masks, the intersection is used.
//!
//! This example is Windows-only, as job objects are a Windows-specific feature.
