/// A wrapper that manages linked instances of `T`, ensuring that only one
/// instance of `T` is created per thread.
///
/// Requires `T: Send + Sync`.
///
/// This is similar to the [`linked::thread_local_arc!` macro][1], with the main difference
/// being that this type operates entirely at runtime using dynamic storage and does
/// not require a static variable to be defined.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// Create an instance of `InstancePerThreadSync` and provide it the initial instance of a linked
/// object `T`. Any instance of `T` accessed through the same `InstancePerThreadSync` or a clone
/// of it will be linked to the same family.
///
#[ doc=mermaid!( "../doc/instance_per_thread_sync.mermaid") ]
///
/// To access the current thread's instance of `T`, you must first obtain a
/// [`RefSync<T>`][RefSync] by calling [`.acquire()`][Self::acquire]. Then you can
/// access the `T` within by simply dereferencing via the `Deref<Target = T>` trait.
///
/// `RefSync<T>` is a thread-aligned type, meaning you can move it to a different thread and even
/// access it across threads but it will still reference the shared instance of `T` from the
/// original thread.
///
/// # Resource management
///
/// A thread-specific instance of `T` is dropped when the last `RefSync` aligned to that thread
/// is dropped, similar to how `Arc<T>` would behave. If a new `RefSync` is later obtained,
/// it is initialized with a new instance of the linked object.
///
/// It is important to emphasize that this means if you only acquire temporary `RefSync`
/// instances then you will get a new instance of `T` every time. The performance impact of
/// this depends on how `T` works internally but you are recommended to keep `RefSync`
/// instances around for reuse when possible.
