# Scope

Prepare the version changes for one pull request. Use configured mode in a
repository adopting the cargo-release-plan publishing toolkit, or standalone mode
when the user explicitly requests a one-off version-increment PR. Do not treat a
missing configuration as permission to run in an unrelated repository.
Do not switch modes to bypass a failed configured check. In a repository that
publishes on merge, an explicit standalone request does not disable that behavior
or waive its required CI gates; make the existing merge behavior clear to the user.

The skill assesses released changes, chooses semantic impacts, previews their
dependency effects and applies the resulting version plan. Review of the complete
pull request approves the result; do not introduce a separate approval pause for
version choices. This skill does not authorize merging, publication, tag creation
or Trusted Publisher administration.

Standalone mode ends with the version-increment PR merged under the repository's
review and merge policy; publishing after that is outside its scope. Completing
the skill does not itself grant merge permission. The shared workflow remains the
canonical supported publishing path.

The CLI, this skill and the reusable GitHub workflows form one toolkit. The
[public guide](https://folo-rs.github.io/folo/cargo-release-plan/) explains adoption.
Repository-specific action pairing and communication rules belong to the caller's
instructions.

# Prerequisites

Git, the selected Cargo/Rust toolchain, `cargo-release-plan`, and
`cargo-semver-checks` must be available. Do not install or upgrade tools without
the caller's applicable permission. Fetching a private configured repository also
requires GitHub CLI authentication.

Check the schema revisions reported by `cargo release-plan version` before
modifying source. This skill consumes plan/report/prepared schema `6`,
semantic-decision schema `2` and compatibility schema `2`. Configured mode also
consumes release-context schema `2`. Matching package version numbers are not a prerequisite.

If schemas differ, update the installed skill from the complete
[canonical skill directory](https://github.com/folo-rs/folo/tree/main/.github/skills/increment-versions),
including its command reference, decision guide and license, and restart with its
instructions. If already working in the canonical repository, report the mismatch
to the caller instead of overwriting the skill under development. If unexpected
CLI errors suggest that tool and skill have diverged despite matching schemas,
consider upgrading both to their latest compatible revisions. Inspect any partial
changes before restarting; an upgrade is not permission to repeat a failed write blindly.
If the updated skill still does not support the tool's schemas, stop and report
the mismatch rather than repeatedly copying the same revision.

In configured mode, use the selected workspace's working-tree
`.cargo/release_plan.toml`, or an explicit configuration override. In standalone
mode, obtain the selected workspace, local release-history ref and optional
parent target ref from the user or explicit task context. Ask for missing inputs;
do not guess them from a publishing setup the repository does not have. No
configuration file, publishing workflow or GitHub remote is required.

Existing tracked files may have staged or unstaged edits; a clean checkout or prior
commit is not required. Newly created release inputs must be tracked before assessment. Stage
those specific paths without disturbing unrelated changes, then collect fresh
evidence. Version planning reads the working tree, not just the staged diff.

# Assessment model

The **release history** is the actual release branch up to one selected commit.
A package's **anchor** supplies the preceding package version and source.
In actual release history it is the newest first-parent commit where that
package's version changed. The **anchor version** is the package version declared
in that commit. Changes after an anchor remain relevant, allowing a repository to
catch up after migration or manual changes without matching version increments.

The **merge target** is the commit the current pull request intends to merge into.
For a stacked PR it can be the tip of an unmerged parent. Supply that target
separately from release history. A parent's pending version and final content are
assessed together as its anticipated squash release and form the child's anchor;
its intermediate commits do not define separate releases. Additional child changes need their own version
movement. Packages still at their release-history version retain their historical
anchors and catch-up obligations.

The managed workflow uses squash merges so each merged PR records its final
content and versions together. Assessment does not depend on whether a merge queue
groups PRs. After a parent merges, refresh the history and target rather than
continuing to use stale evidence.

A **version group** connects tracked workspace members through exact local
requirements such as `=1.2.3`; their versions align. A compatible requirement such
as `1.2.3` permits later compatible releases and does not create a version group.

A **semantic impact** is `breaking`, `nonbreaking` or `patch`, selected by this
skill from the package's changes and consumer promises. A **version plan** translates
those impacts into package versions and required group/dependency changes.

A package has a **pending increment** when its working-tree version is above its
anchor version. Assess every change assigned to that increment. Keep it when
it is sufficient; raise it when a stronger decision requires more movement. Do
not erase or increment it again merely because the skill was rerun.

A **non-publishable package** has `publish = false`. It can participate in
group alignment but receives no publication request or semantic impact. A
publishable private-API package is different: it still has released content.

# Evidence and commands

Read [commands.md](commands.md) for the command examples, placeholder table,
PowerShell error handling and expected outputs. Read the matching command section
before executing each numbered stage below.

Choose new absolute evidence directories outside the repository or under an
already ignored location. The tool writes reports, patches, plans and supporting
files there. Do not edit these generated files manually. The semantic
`decisions.json` is the agent-authored input. Standalone mode also records the
user-selected refs and their resolved commit IDs as a small handoff note, not as
tool-generated publication context. Keep all working evidence out of commits.

Every compatibility output directory must be new. When repeating a stage, choose
new destinations and retain earlier evidence. Record diagnostics as they occur;
missing or malformed output is never an empty successful plan.

# Stage 1: Check prerequisites and select history

Follow [initialization](commands.md#stage-1-check-prerequisites-and-select-history).
Require matching schemas and a named feature branch. For a stacked PR, obtain
its actual target branch/ref from the PR or established session context; do not
silently substitute the repository's release branch.
In standalone mode, confirm that the named branch is the work branch for the
version-increment PR, not the branch it will merge into. Ask when that role is
unclear; a commit ID alone does not identify the intended merge branch.

In configured mode, read `release_history` and optional `merge_target` from the
generated context. In standalone mode, resolve the user-selected refs locally
with Git and supply the resulting commits through the existing planning options.
Keep the original refs for refresh before application. Do not create a dummy
publishing configuration or call `release-context` in standalone mode.

Configured mode runs advisory workspace registry discovery and later requires
the plan-scoped publication gate. Standalone mode skips both: registry readiness
and Trusted Publisher setup are not prerequisites for a version-increment PR.
API comparisons remain separate evidence and can still read published crates.

# Stage 2: Prepare complete evidence

Follow [preparation](commands.md#stage-2-prepare-complete-evidence).
The outcome is a consistent workspace lockfile and a report bound to the source
being assessed. Preparation may update `Cargo.lock`; inspect and retain that
change as part of the contribution.

Read every publishable package in `report.json.packages`, not only file patches.
Include inherited manifest changes and binary dependency changes listed in
`changed`. Read `diff_path` relative to the report directory when present.
Record excluded untracked package paths and their rationale; track intended
release inputs and restart instead of silently omitting them.

Non-publishable packages appear separately for alignment. Do not assign them
semantic impacts or query their registry publication status.

# Stage 3: Assess in dependency order

Follow [assessment ordering](commands.md#stage-3-assess-in-dependency-order).
Read the ordered package batches. Each publishable package appears once,
dependency-first. Assess a cyclic batch until its mutually dependent decisions
settle. Version grouping alone does not create a semantic-assessment cycle.

# Stage 4: Choose semantic impacts

Use [determining-level.md](determining-level.md) for the complete released change
in each package, including all changes covered by a pending increment.

Require `completed: true` in compatibility evidence. A compared package's
`required_impact` supplies a minimum semantic impact; a null value imposes no
minimum, and `compared: false` is not proof of compatibility. The skill's wider
assessment of behavior, CLI, data formats and feature contracts can raise that floor.

Write `decisions.json` with semantic impacts, not numeric version bumps. Omit packages
requiring no semantic increment. Record substantive reasons, including inherited
changes, dependency effects and retained pending versions. Do not invent a Git
anchor for a package absent from release history and the anticipated parent.

# Stage 5: Review resolved effects

Follow [proposal and preview](commands.md#stage-5-review-resolved-effects).
Preview produces the complete package/version set and exact manifest/lockfile
edits, including effects discovered through dependency resolution.

Read its report, patches and compatibility results. Assess new effects and raise
decisions where needed, then repeat proposal/preview from the original prepared
evidence with new output directories. Source edits require new preparation.
Never hand-edit generated plans or widen exact requirements to evade grouping.

Prepare the PR's **Version/release plan** from the union of resolved-plan targets
and pending releases in the final report. Give one row per complete group or
ungrouped package: anchor version, proposed version, semantic impact
and substantive reason. Explain dependent/group movements and retained versions.
Mark non-publishable packages **version alignment only, not published** without
inventing a published predecessor. State explicitly when nothing is to release.

## First-publication handoff

This handoff applies to configured publication, not standalone version planning.
For packages with no comparison anchor, record the known registry state, bootstrap
version and higher first automated-release version. A maintainer bootstraps the
registry identities before first merge and configures Trusted Publishing.
Bootstrap occupies its version, so the automated release needs a higher one.
Do not publish from this skill or infer registry absence from Git history.

# Stage 6: Refresh and apply

Follow [application](commands.md#stage-6-refresh-and-apply).
Refresh the selected release history and target ref. If either changed, use the
recovery procedure below. Configured mode requires the plan-scoped registry gate;
standalone mode refreshes its user-selected refs without a publication gate.

Preserve the pre-application file state and identify the versioning-only delta.
Apply the resolved artifact unchanged, without another approval prompt. Inspect
and report any partial I/O failure before further planning.

# Stage 7: Verify and hand off

Follow [verification](commands.md#stage-7-verify-and-hand-off).
Require complete fresh compatibility evidence and a passing version-readiness check.
Configured mode also checks publication inputs through `--config`; standalone
mode omits that option.
Verify every decision and resolved target against the fresh report. Preserve the
original assessment and account for all intended tracked release inputs.

Commit the intended source/version/requirement/lockfile changes and keep the PR's
release plan current. Follow repository-specific post-version instructions.
Summarize substantive decisions, incomplete comparisons, applicable first-publication work,
excluded untracked paths and execution blockers. When posting on GitHub, put
execution diagnostics in a collapsible section rather than the release table.

Present the standalone result as a version-increment PR for normal review and
merge. Await or perform that merge only under the caller's separate authorization.
The standalone scenario ends there; do not add publishing setup or instructions
for manually invoking publication commands.

# Recovery

When release history or the target advances, undo only the verified generated
versioning delta from this run. Preserve independently authored changes, update
the branch to the intended target and restart with new evidence directories.
Do not reset the worktree or overwrite mixed manifest edits.

Changed source, groups or configuration also require fresh preparation. Changed
semantic impacts alone require proposal and preview again. Fix manifest defects
directly, then regenerate evidence; a malformed requirement is not a semantic choice.
