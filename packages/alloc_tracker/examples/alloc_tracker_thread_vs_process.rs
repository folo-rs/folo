//! Example demonstrating the difference between `measure_thread()` and `measure_process()`.
//!
//! This example shows how to use both `measure_thread()` and `measure_process()` methods
//! to track different types of memory allocations:
//! - `measure_thread()`: Tracks allocations for the current thread only
//! - `measure_process()`: Tracks allocations for the entire process (all threads)
//!
//! Run with: `cargo run --example alloc_tracker_thread_vs_process`
