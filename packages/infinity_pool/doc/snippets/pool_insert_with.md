Inserts an object into the pool via closure and returns a handle to it.

This method allows the caller to partially initialize the object, skipping any `MaybeUninit`
fields that are intentionally not initialized at insertion time. This can make insertion of
objects containing `MaybeUninit` fields faster, although requires unsafe code to implement.

This method is NOT faster than `insert()` for fully initialized objects.
Prefer `insert()` for a better safety posture if you do not intend to
skip initialization of any `MaybeUninit` fields.
