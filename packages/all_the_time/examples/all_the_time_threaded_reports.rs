//! Demonstrating thread-safe `Report` merging with `all_the_time`.
//!
//! This example shows how to use `Report` to combine processor time measurements
//! from multiple threads, including both same-operation merging and different-operation merging.
//!
//! This is not a requirement of using multiple threads but may be a useful feature in cases
//! where multiple independent session needs to be merged. The multithreading is just a simple
//! example case.
//!
//! Run with: `cargo run --example all_the_time_threaded_reports`
