# Workspace observations

This private component supports the [application design](../../cargo-release-plan/docs/design.md)
and is composed as described by its [implementation guide](../../cargo-release-plan/docs/implementation.md).
It owns Git/Cargo observations and the representations needed to interpret them.

Git subprocesses, manifest/member/dependency discovery, inherited-key acquisition,
tracked package contents, installation lock graphs and source/path identity share
this boundary. Git and manifest interpretation may depend on each other inside
the package. Classification, version-group decisions and publication eligibility
belong to callers. Workspace observations retain validated exact dependency edges;
versioning derives their groups.

Path handling probes actual filesystem alias behavior rather than assuming case
sensitivity from the operating system. Dependency membership uses the lexical member
index first, then filesystem-resolved member identity, so caller path spelling does
not remove dependency edges. Shared artifact-file operations own path
resolution and atomic promotion, while callers own serialization and overwrite policy.
Repository-controlled display strings use the diagnostic component's presentation helpers.

Pure parsing and graph tests remain in process. Real Git/Cargo/filesystem tests
belong to boundary integration targets, with hermetic Git identity/configuration.
Shared integration fixtures are opt-in private test support, not acquisition hidden
inside unit tests. Lockfile-closure benchmarks measure only the in-process algorithm.
