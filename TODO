* Identifying and informing of hardware present in system and used for current process
* Mapping of current process to processors in different processor groups (including in multiple processor groups)
* Pinning of current thread to specific processors
* Mapping current process to arbitrary set of N processors (distributed)
* Mapping current process to arbitrary set of N processors (same group)
* Test/benchmark harness that distributes work to multiple processor groups
* Do we want some support for "soft pinning" - prefer one processor but allow others?
* Do we need some consideration for different hierarchy levels? e.g. same physical memory but different caches?
* Do we need to offer any socket-related functionality? In terms of RSS targeting - do we want to be able to pin certain threads to RSS processors or to non-RSS processors? Unclear what may be desirable but there is potential there.
* Support Windows (native)
* Support Linux (libnuma?)
