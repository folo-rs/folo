/// The I/O completion port is used to notify the I/O driver that an I/O operation has completed.
/// It must be associated with each file/socket/handle that is capable of asynchronous I/O. We do
/// not expose this in the public API, just use it internally to implement I/O primitives.
///
/// There are two different types of I/O completion ports in Folo:
///
/// 1. Each async worker thread has a single I/O completion port dedicated for all thread-isolated
///    I/O operations that never extend outside that thread.
/// 2. There is a shared I/O completion port used for multithreaded I/O operations. All async worker
///    threads share this and process I/O whose completion is scheduled via this port.
///
/// This is a thread-isolated completion port that can only be used to process completions on a
/// single thread. Note that I/O events may still be added to the completion port from other
/// threads - this is used to implement I/O wake signals via `IoWaker`. While the CompletionPort
/// type itself is single-threaded, the `CompletionPortHandle` is thread-safe and can be used to
/// schedule I/O completions from any thread.
/// 
/// Uses interior mutability for simplicity of operation - synchronization happens on OS level.
